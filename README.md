# CNC-DRAWING-MACHINE
My senior project description

INTRODUCTION
1.0	 Project Background. 
CNC Machines are Computerized Numerical Control Machines, which are used to draw anything or design any mechanical part according to the design program fed into their controller unit. Controller unit can be either computer or microcontroller. CNC machines have stepper and servomotors to draw the design as per the fed program.
1.1 Statement of the Problem
For many years, drawing in different areas of engineering has always been done by hand or by using printers after sketching a drawing on the computer. The basic skill of drawing may at the same time not be common to all engineering students when we focus on accuracy and precision of drawings. In courses such as technical drawing, many students complete the course without attaining the 100% accuracy in the skill required such as dimensioning and measurements. This system will therefore make students manage situations where technical drawing is needed where they can create programs that will enable them complete the drawing task more efficiently.
1.1	 Project Justification
This project based on automatic CNC drawing machine will give users especially learners in education institutions an experience that CNC machining provides such as unmatched precision, repeatability and accuracy. Learners can have a first-hand experience with CNC technology even before getting a chance to handle them in the industry field. This is the main motive behind constructing and implementation of this project.
1.3 Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to create a low-cost effective drawing machine that will provide a user interactive automated experience in technical drawing where one can predict moves necessary to draw any kind of shape and be able to convert movements into written instructions. 
1.3.1 Specific Objectives
1.	To create a low-cost portable CNC drawing machine.
2.	To make drawing of complex sketches easier.
3.	To improve the productivity of artistic work using the machine.
4.	To develop a cost-effective machine for commercial use.
5.	To enhance educational experience through precise drawings.
1.4 Significance of The Project
This project will aim at eliminating problems related in drawing such as lacking of necessary and precise dimensions, conflicting dimensions or even unclear drawings. Drawings such as mechanical drawings are the basis for technicians to process and manufacture mechanical parts. A drawing is handed over by the mechanical designer engineers to the to the production department. The designers express their desires in a drawing of a CNC machine part, and the production department carries out the manufacturing and inspection according to the drawing. Therefore, a right-on hand drawing helps to accelerate the production process with best cost and for as little time as possible. 
1.5 Methodology 
This project paper is a practical based unit/component and a descriptive write-up focusing on enhancing student experience in technical drawing in either 2D or 3D while at the same time appreciating the importance of programing and coding application in engineering drawing. Its advantage ensures higher efficiency, higher flexibility, and low production cost, a little working time, and a little loss in production. It mainly follows three steps that are receiving data, interpreting them and react accordingly.
1.6 Scope and Limitations
CNC machining which includes the automatic CNC drawing machine is the future until any better technologies is developed. There are many industries, which are still depended on the traditional machine, and machining, in future these industries will be using cnc machines.

Reason:
•	Better quality
•	Better productivity and product time
•	Less defects and more accuracy and there are many reasons.
CNC machining offers some drawbacks, such as cost, size limitations and the potential for operator error.
1.7 Advantages
This machine can make jobs with high accuracy and with precision than any other manual machine.
	It can work for 24 hours a day.
	The parts produced by the CNC machine have the same dimension. There is no variation in the parts manufactured in the same machine.
	There is no need for highly skilled workers to operate this machine. A semi-skilled worker can run the machine more accurately and precisely.
	Operators can easily make changes and improvements and with that reduce time.
	This machine can make complex designs with high accuracy in minimum time.
	With modern design software, the designer simulates the idea. In addition, there is no requirement to make a prototype or model which saves time and money.
	There are fewer workers required to operate a machine, which saves the labor cost.
